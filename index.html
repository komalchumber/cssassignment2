                Hii,
                My name is Komal. I'm from India. I came to Canada in january for my next studies. I live here with my
                friends. I am currently working in a factory named as Magna in Newmarket. I'm an introvert person. There
                are 4 members in my family. I lost my Father in a very small age. Now, I am working hard because I want
                to make my family proud. I love singing. In my free time listen to music to relax my mind.


            </p>
